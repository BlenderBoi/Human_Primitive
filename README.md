Human Primitive is a Addon that adds Human Base Mesh and tedious or commonly use Human Body Parts as Primitive into the Add Mesh Menu. 



The purpose of the addon is to add Simple Human / Human Parts as a Primitive, so this is not a highly customizable Human Maker, instead this is a Simple Human Mesh Primitive, focusing on lower poly models, with different detail level / topology style to start from. 


# Applications / Uses:

- Quickly to populate your scene with placeholder Generic Base Human.
- This addon can be a good starting point for you to model your Character, it offers different Detail Level / Topology Style to Choose from.
- Can be Act as a Dummy Character For Test Rigging / Test Animation
- Add Commonly tedious part of human like Hand, Feet, Eye, Ears to attach to your model
- Access the Model from Shift - A / Add Menu, just like any Primitives

# IMPORTANT Note:

- While the Model does have Basic un-optimized UV Map, it is not a fine tuned UV Map, it is just there if you just want to do some basic texturing. 
- No Texture or Shader is included (Exception: Eye Model get a Very Basic Shader)
- The Model are not Game Ready
- This is not a Human Designer Addon but merely a simple "Primitive Asset" Addon. 
- You should treat this addon like a primitive addon, similar to "Extra Objects Addon"
